<a id="my-approach" class="anchor" href="#my-approach" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>My Approach</h2>

<p>Besides creating a <strong>Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</strong> I decided that the main goal of this project was to achieve a <strong>Separation of Concerns</strong>. This therefore meant keeping the <strong>business logic</strong> separate from the <strong>User Interface (UI)</strong>. My approach was to therefore work on the logic first and then once all the logic was in place and all the tests were passing (via <strong>RSpec</strong>) I would work on the layout of the website.</p>

<p>In previous projects I had usually created a single controller to manage all the logic but for this one I decided to create several controllers (listed below) so that my code could be even further separated. The benefits of this are that each controller would have one <strong>single responsibility</strong> and furthermore it would be easier to make a change to any controller.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/hsheikhm/chitter-challenge/blob/master/app/controllers/base_controller.rb">Base Controller</a> (Responsible for app configuration and helper methods).</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/hsheikhm/chitter-challenge/blob/master/app/controllers/maker_controller.rb">Maker Controller</a> (Responsible for login, sign up and logout features).</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/hsheikhm/chitter-challenge/blob/master/app/controllers/peep_controller.rb">Peep Controller</a> (Responsible for creating a new peep/message).</li>
</ul>

<p>I had created the app in <strong>Ruby</strong> and also adopted the <strong>Sinatra</strong> framework since they go really well together. As for storing the users and peeps, this was achieved by using <strong>DataMapper</strong> and <strong>PostGresQL</strong>. I had also used the '<strong>Bcrypt</strong>' gem to encrypt passwords.</p>

<p>One reason why I really like Sinatra is that you can benefit from using its <strong>layout</strong> template for styling the app. I therefore used a layout file to style the common features of the app and further created separate views for login, sign up and home etc. I had adopted <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>Bootstrap</strong> to style the app.</p>
