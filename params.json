This therefore meant keeping the **business logic** separate from the **User Interface (UI)**. My approach was to therefore work on the logic first and then once all the logic was in place and all the tests were passing (via **RSpec**) I would work on the layout of the website.\r\n\r\nIn previous projects I had usually created a single controller to manage all the logic but for this one I decided to create several controllers (listed below) so that my code could be even further separated. The benefits of this are that each controller would have one **single responsibility** and furthermore it would be easier to make a change to any controller.\r\n\r\n* [Base Controller](https://github.com/hsheikhm/chitter-challenge/blob/master/app/controllers/base_controller.rb) (Responsible for app configuration and helper methods).\r\n* [Maker Controller](https://github.com/hsheikhm/chitter-challenge/blob/master/app/controllers/maker_controller.rb) (Responsible for login, sign up and logout features).\r\n* [Peep Controller](https://github.com/hsheikhm/chitter-challenge/blob/master/app/controllers/peep_controller.rb) (Responsible for creating a new peep/message).\r\n\r\n\r\nI had created the app in **Ruby** and also adopted the **Sinatra** framework since they go really well together. As for storing the users and peeps, this was achieved by using **DataMapper** and **PostGresQL**. I had also used the '**Bcrypt**' gem to encrypt passwords.\r\n\r\nOne reason why I really like Sinatra is that you can benefit from using its **layout** template for styling the app. I therefore used a layout file to style the common features of the app and further created separate views for login, sign up and home etc. I had adopted **HTML**, **CSS** and **Bootstrap** to style the app.\r\n\r\n## Directory Structure\r\n\r\n```\r\n├── app/\r\n│   ├── controllers/\r\n│   │   ├── base_controller.rb\r\n│   │   ├── maker_controller.rb\r\n│   │   └── peep_controller.rb\r\n│   │\r\n│   ├── models/\r\n│   │   ├── maker.rb\r\n│   │   └── peep.rb\r\n│   │\r\n│   ├── public/\r\n│   │   ├── css/\r\n│   │   ├── fonts/\r\n│   │   ├── images/\r\n│   │   └── js/\r\n│   │\r\n│   ├── views/\r\n│   │   ├── maker/\r\n│   │   │   ├── home.erb\r\n│   │   │   ├── login.erb\r\n│   │   │   └── signup.erb\r\n│   │   └── layout.erb\r\n│   │\r\n│   ├── app.rb\r\n│   └── data_mappper_setup.rb\r\n│\r\n├── spec/\r\n│   │── features/\r\n│   ├── models/\r\n│   ├── spec_helper.rb\r\n│   └── web_helpers.rb\r\n│\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## App Usage and Features\r\n\r\nSnapshots of the app's features can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/hsheikhm/chitter-challenge#app-usage-and-features)\r\n\r\n## Demo App\r\n\r\nVisit the link below to see a live version of the app.\r\n\r\nhttps://welcome-to-chitter.herokuapp.com/signup\r\n\r\n## Download Instructions\r\n\r\nFollow the below instructions on your terminal to download the app:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/hsheikhm/chitter-challenge.git\r\n$ cd chitter-challenge\r\n$ bundle\r\n$ rackup\r\n\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
